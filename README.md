Welcome to the MeatSpace web component library. 

[meat-space.org](https://meat-space.org)

## Getting Started
The following instructions will get our web components installed and running locally on your machine.

### Installing
The easiest way to get our webcomponents is to include the following into the head of your html document:
```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@meatspace/webcomponents@latest/bundle.js"></script>
```
Otherwise, you'll need to have the following installed:
* Nodejs
* npm

Assuming you have started a nodejs project, have a `package.json` file set up, and are in the root directory of your poject, run
```
npm install --save @meatspace/webcomponents
```
### Usage & Example
In your HTML page `<head>` element, add a `<script>` tag like so
```
<script type="module" src="/node_modules/@meatspace/webcomponents/bundle.js"></script>
```
Next, add the component into your HTML body
```
<core-hello rainbow lang="en">this is a test!</core-hello>
```
